//Assignment for programming. Create a hud. Like a engine system, weapons system,
//etc. The hud should include information, interactable and (optional) complexity.
//Think of a fallout pip boy as an example of hud.
/*
ideas for the hud: 1:The BAE sytems (jet fighter hud with altitude and stuff)
 2)Engine system (space ship) (kind of alreaday made) with hyoer warp.(not creative as it's already used.
 3)Weapon charging station. With button to press to charge up the weapon then a red button to fire.
 Has to be 3d. Looking up to press various buttons. Look down to press the red fire button.
 4)Car hud. showing speed and stuff.
 
 ->by the looks of it, i will be going for the jet fighter
 
 but i will also do a weapons system too.
 
 change of mind. we are doing the weap9ons system. (look at note book for picture diagram)
